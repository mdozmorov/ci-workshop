R/Bioconductor for Cancer Informatics
=====================================

This package contains code, data, and documentation related to a
R/Bioconductor workshop presented in January 2013 at Rajiv Gandhi Centre
for Biotechnology.

Schedule
--------

### Day 1 (Jan 16)

-   Morning: Welcome and lectures
-   1:30 - 3:30 \| Introduction to R/Bioconductor (CG)
-   4:00 - 5:00 \| Microarray data retrieval & preprocessing (MD)

### Day 2 (Jan 17)

-   Morning: lectures
-   11:00 - 12:30 \| Finding differentially expressed genes (MD,CG)
-   1:30 - 3:30 \| Prediction analysis (MD,CG)
-   4:00 - 5:00 \| Annotation and enrichment analysis (CG)

### Day 3 (Jan 18)

- 9:30 - 10:30 \| Clustering & visualization (MD)
- 11:00 - 12:30 \| Network analysis (CG) 
- 1:30 - 3:30 \| Introduction to high-throughput sequencing analysis (CG)

TODO
----

-   Figure out if rgl (required for NeatMap) is feasible to install
-   Write \"Prerequisites\" section, to include links to R, RStudio,
    install Bioconductor
-   Have CEL files, GDS858.soft.gz, GPL96.soft available offline
-   1:30 - 3:30 \| Array CGH & Intermediate R (CG) 

# Prerequisites 

### R base

Before the workshop begins, please install, at minimum, R from the
following address:

-   Windows: <http://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/>
-   Other OSes: <http://www.r-project.org/>

If you are using Linux, it is recommended to install from your system\'s
package manager.

### RStudio or another R IDE

RStudio is not required, but if you are new to R and/or use Windows, it
is highly recommended. It is a free download from:

-   <http://www.rstudio.com/>

If you use vim, a combination of vim-slime with tmux or screen works
well. If you use emacs, the ESS (Emacs Speaks Statistics) package is
popular among R users.

Additional Resources
